                    I am an incoming PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I will be working with Dr. Scott Neikum and the <a ref="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~sniekum/index.php">SCALAR Lab</a>. Prior to this, I did an MS in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I was fortunate to be advised by Dr. Bradley Hayes and be a part of the Collaborative Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Labotatory <a href="http://www.cairo-lab.com/">(CAIRO Lab)</a>.
                    My research is at the intersection of Human preference learning and AI safety. I am particularly intested in designing AI systems that are safe and better human aligned.

                    I completed my undergrad from Delhi Technological University in 2019, where I majored in 'Information Technology'.
                    I have also worked as a Software Developer with Citicorp Services India Pvt. Ltd. before joining the master's program.

                    BREAKING THE TIE: EVALUATING HUMAN PREFERENCES IN REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br>The work operationalizes an evaluation approach to determine the acceptability of human preference and obtain notions of bounded risk in learning from preferences. The threshold for risk is defined based on the distribution of expected rewards returned for the optimal policy and different user policies are evaluated for acceptability. Our results show that the approach can identify which policies are acceptable given our tolerance for risk. It is also able to remove failed demonstrations based on the evaluation. <br>

                    <br>The robot maintains a belief over the human's goal, continually updating based on human’s motion at each time step. A POMDP framework is used to figure out the best action for the anipulator arm by reasoning over uncertainty in the human goal.<br>

                    IMITATING HUMAN-LIKE DRIVING USING INVERSE RL IN WEBOTS
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br>Implemented a Maximum Entropy Deep Inverse RL approach on human-like demonstration data. The data was generated using
                    the vehicle ”Tesla Model 3” on Webots Robot simulator, driven around using keyboard controls.<br>
                    <br>A deep neural network with two hidden layers of dimension 3 was used to estimate the reward structure. The state space was
                    discretised and state visitation frequencies used as features to learn the weights for the network.<br>
                    <br>The obtained policy showed promising results by exhibiting driving behaviour which was very close to the human-demonstrator.<br>
